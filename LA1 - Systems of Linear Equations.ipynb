Soon all we will care about is the scaffoling. The $2$D arrays that we printed out are just $\\textbf{matrices}$ as you have possibly seen before. They are effectively little packages of information that we can manipulate to solve problems, but they have even deeper mathematical roots. In time we will pull away from everything else and just leave the matrices. Solving in a few simple algorithmic steps, particularly if we don't have to handwrite everything, is a lot more forgiving than the substitution loop of chaos.\n",
